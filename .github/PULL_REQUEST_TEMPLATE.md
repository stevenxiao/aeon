### New skill

> New skills ship as your own **community skill pack** — use *Community skill pack listing* below. This checklist is only for changes to the **core** catalog (maintainers).

- [ ] `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter has `name:`, `category:`, `description:`, `tags:` (plus `requires:` / `mcp:` if it needs keys or MCP servers)
- [ ] Body is self-contained and includes a **Network note** with the right path (`./secretcurl` for auth'd APIs / `gh api` for GitHub / `curl` + WebFetch for public)
- [ ] Notifies through `./notify`, never a channel API directly
- [ ] Ran `bin/generate-skills-json && bin/generate-packs-json` and committed both regenerated manifests

### New LLM gateway

- [ ] Wired through the five files (`gateway-registry.ts`, `AuthModal.tsx`, `secrets-catalog.ts`, `scripts/llm-gateway.sh`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`) — see [Contributing an LLM gateway](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-an-llm-gateway)
- [ ] Added a row to the gateway table in [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#llm-gateways)
- [ ] Verified end to end — a run logs `gateway=auto resolved to <slug>`

### Community skill pack listing

- [ ] Pack repo is public with a clear license (MIT / Apache-2.0)
- [ ] Pack has a `skills-pack.json` manifest at its root and a `SKILL.md` per skill
- [ ] Write / onchain / bet skills are `default_enabled: false`
- [ ] This PR adds **both** a README table row and a matching `skill-packs.json` entry
- [ ] `node scripts/validate-skill-packs.mjs` passes (registry shape + README parity, incl. the pack counter)
- [ ] No monkey-patching of Aeon internals; no private or auth-walled endpoints required to run

### Core fix (dashboard / scripts / workflows / docs)

- [ ] Change is focused — one concern, no unrelated refactor
- [ ] Touched code follows the existing pattern in the file
- [ ] Relevant CI gates pass locally (e.g. `bash scripts/check-skill-categories.sh`, `bash scripts/check-capabilities-parity.sh`)
- [ ] Touched `apps/**`? That app typechecks, tests, and builds (dashboard: `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`)
