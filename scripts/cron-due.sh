# cron-due.sh — decide whether a cron-scheduled skill is due to run *now*.
#
# Replaces the scheduler's old "fire on the first tick past the minute + a fixed
# 2-hour catch-up + a flat dedup window" heuristic with one exact rule:
#
#     A skill is DUE  iff  its most recent scheduled fire time at-or-before now
#     (within the last CATCHUP_HOURS) is NEWER than its last dispatch.
#
# This is the "debt ledger" model. A missed run stays owed until some tick —
# however late — pays it, bounded by CATCHUP_HOURS so genuinely stale slots
# (older than the cap) are skipped rather than fired hours late. Because the
# decision is anchored to the *exact* scheduled slot (not wall-clock proximity),
# it cannot double-fire and needs no separate dedup window.
#
# Why this exists: GitHub only delivers ~10% of the */5 scheduler ticks, so gaps
# routinely exceed the old 2h catch-up window and a due slot would silently age
# out and never run. See docs and the "Determine and dispatch" step in
# .github/workflows/scheduler.yml.
#
# Usage:
#   cron-due.sh "<min hour dom month dow>" <now_epoch> <last_dispatch_epoch> [catchup_hours]
#
# Exit 0 (DUE)  → prints the matched slot time (ISO 8601) to stdout.
# Exit 1 (skip) → no output.
#
# Env: AEON_DATE overrides the `date` binary. When unset, GNU and BSD/macOS
#      date are detected automatically.
