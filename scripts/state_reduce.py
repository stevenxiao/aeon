"""
state_reduce — fold append-only run events into the cron-state schema (hardening §3).

Today `memory/cron-state.json` is a shared file rewritten on every skill run, which
forces the rebase-retry + auto-conflict-resolver loop in aeon.yml (git used as a
concurrent DB). The fix: each run *appends* an immutable event (a GitHub Issue
comment — no commit, no conflict), and the canonical state is *derived* by folding
the events. This module is that fold, kept pure so it's unit-testable.

Event (one JSON object per line on stdin):
  {"skill":"x","status":"success|failed","ts":"2026-06-17T12:00:00Z",
   "quality_score":4,"error":"sig"}   # quality_score/error optional
A "dispatched" event (posted by the scheduler when it kicks off a run) carries
only {"skill","status":"dispatched","ts"} and advances the dispatch watermark
(last_dispatch) without counting as a run outcome.

Output: the same aggregate shape aeon.yml's apply_state_update produces, so heartbeat
/ skill-health read it unchanged.
