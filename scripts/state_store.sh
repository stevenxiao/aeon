# state_store — append-only run state on a GitHub Issue (hardening §3).
#
# Replaces the shared memory/cron-state.json file (rewritten + force-pushed with a
# 5x rebase-retry + auto-conflict-resolver on every run) with conflict-free appends:
# each run posts an immutable comment; canonical state is derived by folding them
# (scripts/state_reduce.py). Concurrent runs never race — comments are independent.
#
# Repo: honors the GH_REPO env var (else gh's current-dir repo).
# Usage:
#   scripts/state_store.sh ensure <title>             -> prints issue number (creates if absent)
#   scripts/state_store.sh append <issue> <json>      -> post one event comment
#   scripts/state_store.sh read   <issue>             -> fold comments -> cron-state JSON (stdout)
#   scripts/state_store.sh materialize <title> <file> -> ensure+read, atomically write the
#                                                        folded projection to <file> (for readers)
