# skill_mode — capability tier resolution for a skill run (hardening §6).
#
# Two axes of capability: network (egress:, future proxy) and *write* (this).
# A skill declares its write tier in SKILL.md frontmatter:
#     mode: read-only      # may read repo + fetch web + notify; may NOT mutate the repo
#     mode: write          # full access (default, current behaviour)
#
# Default is `write` for backward compatibility: most skills legitimately write
# (create-skill, article, reflect…), so read-only is opt-in per SKILL.md.
#
# This script decides the TIER. It is not, by itself, the enforcement — see
# docs/CAPABILITIES.md for the full picture. The allowedTools string below is one
# of three layers: the tier also reaches `run-harness --mode`, which write-locks
# the workspace with an OS sandbox (harness-adapter/lib/sandbox.sh) on every
# harness, and a post-run guard in the workflow reverts anything that still
# landed. The allowlist alone was never sufficient — a shell redirection routes
# around it, and only claude and pi consume it at all.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/skill_mode.sh mode <skill-name>     -> prints read-only | write
#   scripts/skill_mode.sh allowed-tools <mode>  -> prints the --allowedTools string
#   scripts/skill_mode.sh grok-run-env <skill>  -> prints `export GROK_*=…` lines

# Tools every tier gets: read, search, notify, and read-only/local shell helpers.
# curl stays (network is the *other* axis, governed by egress:, not by mode).
#
# NOTE: `gh` is intentionally NOT in the read-only base — even `gh api` GET reads are
# excluded, because `gh` is also a write vector (issue/PR/commit/dispatch) and the tool
# grammar is coarse (Bash(gh:*) is all-or-nothing). A read-only skill that needs GitHub
# data should fetch it with WebFetch/curl against api.github.com, or stay `mode: write`.
# (Known degraders today: github-trending + security-digest use `gh api` only as a
# fallback behind a WebFetch/curl primary, so they degrade gracefully, not break.)

# command-chaining. With no grant here, that officially-recommended pattern
# itself fails: a standalone `cd` call has no more permission than a
# multi-line call that happens to start with one. A multi-line/compound Bash
# call is denied unless every sub-command in it is allowlisted, so `cd <dir>\n<real work>`
# denies the whole call, real work included, even when every command after
# the cd is itself allowlisted — live-observed on defi-overview/
# narrative-tracker (permission_denials on a cd-prefixed multi-line call).
# cd only changes the invoking shell's own cwd — no file/network effect of

# The run-audit wrapper. Five skills (skill-health, heartbeat, cost-report,
# retrospective, self-review) document ./scripts/skill-runs as a primary data
# source, but no tier granted it, so every documented call was denied. That was
# the trigger for ISS-001 on aeon-compute: skill-health, unable to reach its own
# data source, burned turns working around the denial and hit the 30m GH Actions
# job timeout on two consecutive runs. Safe in the base tier: the script only
# does `gh api` GET reads + jq + date (no repo/network mutation), and its inner
# `gh` runs inside the script's own subshell, so granting the wrapper does NOT
# re-open the broad `Bash(gh:*)` write vector that the read-only base

# invocation ("requires approval") and the scan arm silently degrades to manual review —

# --- Why there is no grok permission mapping here ---------------------------
# There used to be a `grok-args` subcommand that emitted grok's own permission
# grammar (`--allow 'Bash(git *)'` rules plus `--sandbox read-only`) as this
# script's grok-side mirror of allowedTools. It is DELETED, not merely unused,
# and it should not come back in that shape — both halves of it were wrong:
#
#   * The `--allow` rules never gated anything. grok aborts its ENTIRE turn on a
#     denied tool (stopReason=Cancelled) rather than degrading, and skills are
#     authored for Claude Code, so they reach for tools no allowlist predicted.
#     harness-adapter/adapters/grok.sh therefore runs --permission-mode
#     bypassPermissions and carries NO allowlist and NO --deny rules, on purpose.
#   * grok's own `--sandbox read-only` is silently ignored on grok 0.2.101 (writes
#     still land) and nest-conflicts with the wrapper sandbox.
#
# So read-only on grok — as on all seven harnesses — is enforced by the dispatcher's
# OS sandbox (harness-adapter/lib/sandbox.sh: bwrap / sandbox-exec write-locks the
# workspace) plus the workflow's post-run revert. Nothing about that is expressible
# in this file, which is why the mapping is gone instead of rewritten.

# --- Grok Build run-shaping: frontmatter -> GROK_* env -----------------------
# Map optional per-skill frontmatter to the env vars harness-adapter's grok
# adapter reads, so a
# skill can opt into grok's newer headless features without any workflow change:
#
#   effort: high            # low|medium|high|xhigh|max  -> --effort
#   reasoning_effort: high  # same set                   -> --reasoning-effort
#   max_turns: 60           # agentic-turn cap           -> --max-turns
#   best_of_n: 3            # run N ways, keep the best   -> --best-of-n
#   verify: true            # append a self-check loop    -> --check
#
# Output is `export GROK_X=...` lines for exactly the fields present, so unset
# fields fall through to the adapter's defaults. aeon.yml's grok branch evals this.
# (This note used to reserve GROK_JSON_SCHEMA for the scorer. The scorer never
# set it and now goes schema-less deliberately, so the knob is gone.)
# read one frontmatter scalar (first '---' block), stripping inline # comment,
# quotes and surrounding whitespace. Prints nothing if absent.
