# Telegram Instant Mode

Default polling checks for messages every 5 minutes. For ~1s response time, deploy
the Cloudflare Worker in [`../apps/webhook/`](../apps/webhook/) as a Telegram webhook.

The Worker is now a self-contained, one-click-deployable package — source,
`wrangler.toml`, and full setup instructions live in
**[`apps/webhook/README.md`](../apps/webhook/README.md)**, including the "Deploy to
Cloudflare" button.

In short:

1. Deploy `webhook/` to your own Cloudflare account (button or `npx wrangler deploy`).
2. Fill in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
   `GITHUB_REPO`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the deploy wizard prompts for them (or set
   them as Worker secrets via `wrangler secret put` when deploying from a clone).
   `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is required — the Worker rejects every update with a
   `403` until it's set. If `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is a **group**, also set the optional
   `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_ID` to your numeric user id, or button taps and messages
   from any group member are ignored (fail-closed) — see the
   [owner gate](telegram-commands.md#owner-gate).
3. Point your bot at the Worker, passing the **same** value as `secret_token`:
   ```bash
   curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://your-worker.workers.dev&secret_token=<YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET>"
   ```

Once a webhook is active the poller detects it via `getWebhookInfo` and skips the
Telegram branch, so polling and the webhook never conflict.
