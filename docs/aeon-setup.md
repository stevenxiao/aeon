# The Aeon setup skill

Aeon ships an **[Agent Skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)** (`SKILL.md`) that turns *"how do I set up / schedule / fix this?"* into a guided chat. It's the fastest way to drive your instance — you describe what you want in plain language and it runs the right `./aeon` commands for you, with the silent-failure traps already baked in.

It's a portable skill, not tied to one product: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) is the primary host (it auto-loads skills from `.claude/skills/`, so it's zero-install there), but the skill is just a `SKILL.md` in the open Agent Skills format — it works with **Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, or OpenClaw**, and any other agent tool that supports skills.

> **This is not an Aeon skill.** The 60+ skills under [`skills/`](../skills) run unattended on GitHub Actions. **This** one runs inside *your* agent session on *your* machine — it's the operator's assistant for configuring the instance, not something that runs on a schedule. It doesn't appear in `aeon.yml`, the packs, or the catalog.

## What it does

You don't have to learn `aeon.yml`, cron syntax, or the CLI flags. Mention Aeon (or type `/aeon`) and it picks the right mode:

| Mode | Ask it when you want to… |
|---|---|
| **Start** | Stand up a brand-new instance and get one real notification on your phone, fast |
| **Reschedule** | Change when a skill runs, its cadence, or what it focuses on ("move the digest to 7am", "weekdays only") |
| **Unblock** | Figure out why a skill "didn't run" — it walks the ordered checklist (disabled? unquoted schedule? Actions off? wrong repo?) |
| **Chat → skill** | Turn something you just did in the agent into a scheduled skill |
| **Edit a skill** | Change what an existing skill does — a source, a filter, tone, length |
| **What to turn on** | Pick skills for what you care about, browse packs, install community packs |
| **Strategy & voice** | Set `STRATEGY.md` (the north star) and `soul/` (the voice every run speaks in) |

It knows the things that silently break an instance — an unquoted `schedule:` that never fires, `gh` pointed at the wrong repo, a missing secret — and it verifies as it goes instead of guessing. (The config-side of that knowledge is also enforced continuously by the [`aeon-doctor`](../skills/aeon-doctor/SKILL.md) skill.)

## Install

You need **[`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) authenticated** (`gh auth login`) — the skill drives everything through the GitHub CLI, same as the dashboard.

### Option A — it's already in your repo (zero-install in Claude Code) · recommended

Every Aeon instance ships this skill at [`.claude/skills/aeon/`](../.claude/skills/aeon). Claude Code auto-loads skills from a project's `.claude/skills/`, so there's nothing to install:

1. Open your Aeon repo folder in Claude Code — the [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) or JetBrains extension, or the `claude` CLI in that directory.
2. Type **`/aeon`** (or just mention Aeon / `aeon.yml` / "schedule a skill") and answer its questions.

### Option B - install as a Claude Code or Codex plugin (from any folder, one command)

The setup skill also ships as a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins), so you can install it from a marketplace instead of copying files: versioned, and updatable with `/plugin update`.

```
/plugin marketplace add aeonfun/aeon
/plugin install aeon@aeon
```

Then type `/aeon` in any session and point it at your instance when it asks which repo. Update later with `/plugin update aeon@aeon`, or remove it with `/plugin uninstall aeon@aeon`. (The plugin lives in the [`plugin/`](../plugin) subdirectory of this repo, a self-contained copy of the setup skill, so installing it never pulls in the unattended `skills/` catalog.)

The same plugin installs on **Codex** too - it ships a Codex manifest and a repo-scoped marketplace catalog (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`):

```
codex plugin marketplace add aeonfun/aeon
codex plugin add aeon@aeon
```

### Option C - install it globally by hand (use it from any folder)

Prefer to copy files instead of using the plugin? Drop the skill into your personal Claude Code skills directory so `/aeon` works in every session:

```bash
cp -R .claude/skills/aeon ~/.claude/skills/aeon
```

Then open **any** directory in Claude Code and type `/aeon`; point it at your instance when it asks which repo.

### Option D - another agent tool

The skill is a standard `SKILL.md` (plus a `references/` folder). Any agent that supports [Agent Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) — Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw, and others — can use it: drop `.claude/skills/aeon/` into that tool's skills location. Everything it does is plain `gh` + `./aeon` commands, so nothing about it is Claude-Code-specific beyond where the file is loaded from.

## How it relates to the dashboard & CLI

Three front doors, one engine — all of them read and write the same `aeon.yml` + repo secrets:

- **Dashboard** (`./aeon` → `localhost:5555`) — click-driven setup, best for first run. See [Quick start](../.github/README.md#quick-start).
- **CLI** (`./aeon skills …`, `./aeon secrets …`) — scriptable, `--json`-friendly. See [Command line](../apps/cli/README.md).
- **This skill** (`/aeon` in your agent) — conversational; you say what you want, it runs the CLI and confirms the result.

Use whichever fits the moment — the skill is just the CLI with judgment on top.
