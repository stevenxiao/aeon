# Aeon secrets and variables — where to get each one

## How to set anything

**Secrets** (credentials — write-only, can't be read back):

```bash
./aeon secrets set NAME --stdin      # paste the value, then Ctrl-D
./aeon secrets ls --set              # what's configured
./aeon secrets ls --unset            # what's missing
./aeon secrets rm NAME
```

Always `--stdin`. Passing a key as an argument puts it in shell history.

**Variables** (non-secret behaviour toggles — readable):

```bash
gh variable set NAME "value"
gh variable list
```

Getting the two mixed up is the most common setup mistake. A credential in variables is exposed; a toggle in secrets works but you can't read it back to check what it's set to.

Three things worth knowing:

- **Secrets are per-repo.** A forked instance inherits none of the parent's keys. That's deliberate — billing isolation and blast-radius containment.
- **Optional keys** are marked `KEY?` in a skill's `requires:`. Missing means the skill degrades to a public/lower-quality path, not that it breaks.
- **Two secrets have side effects when set:** `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` auto-registers the Telegram slash-command menu, and any gateway key re-resolves which provider the runs route through.

## 1. Model auth — need at least one

The first two are the direct-to-Anthropic options; the rest are gateways. Setting several is fine and encouraged — the runner cascades through them and fails over.

| Secret | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Run `claude setup-token` locally → paste the `sk-ant-oat01-…` (valid 1 year). Or click AUTH in the dashboard. Runs on your Pro/Max subscription, no per-token billing |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | console.anthropic.com — pay-as-you-go `sk-ant-…`. Also accepts any Anthropic-compatible key for a proxy |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | openrouter.ai/keys — `sk-or-…` |
| `BANKR_LLM_KEY` | bankr.bot/api-keys — `bk_…`, discounted Opus |
| `USEPOD_TOKEN` | usepod.ai — token is embedded in the base URL, treat as secret |
| `VENICE_API_KEY` | venice.ai/settings/api — routed through a local translator sidecar |
| `SURPLUS_API_KEY` | surplusintelligence.ai — `inf_…`, settles USDC on Base. Fund the wallet and `approve()` once before first use |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | console.x.ai — `xai-…`. Triple duty: X/tweet skills, the Grok gateway, and API-key auth for the grok harness |
| `GROK_CREDENTIALS` | Dashboard → AUTH → **Connect X account**. Base64 of your `~/.grok` session; runs the grok harness on a SuperGrok / X Premium+ entitlement. No CLI path for this one |

## 2. Notification channels — need at least one

| Secret | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Message @BotFather → `/newbot` → copy the token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Message your new bot, then open `api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` and read `message.chat.id` |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → Copy URL (outbound only) |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` + `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | discord.com/developers/applications → your app → Bot. Add the `channels:history` scope. Only needed for inbound commands |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | api.slack.com/apps → Create App → Incoming Webhooks → Install → Copy URL |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | Same app → add `channels:history` + `reactions:write` scopes. Only for inbound |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` + `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO` | resend.com/api-keys. Powers **all** outbound email — the notification channel, emailed digests, and security disclosures |
| `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` + `BUZZ_CHANNEL_ID` (+ `BUZZ_RELAY_URL`) | [Buzz](https://buzz.xyz) (Block's Nostr-relay workspace). `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY` is the agent's `nsec` keypair, `BUZZ_CHANNEL_ID` the target channel UUID (`buzz channels list`), `BUZZ_RELAY_URL` your relay (defaults to localhost). Outbound only; needs the `buzz` CLI staged in the run |

Telegram is the fastest to set up and the only one with inline buttons and slash-commands. Start there.

**If the channel isn't private to you**, set `DISCORD_ALLOWED_AUTHOR_ID` / `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_ID` (variables). Left unset, *anyone* in the channel can command the agent. Telegram is already scoped to a single chat ID.

## 3. GitHub tokens

| Secret | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Built in — nothing to set. Scoped to this repo only |
| `GH_GLOBAL` | github.com/settings/tokens -> **Tokens (classic)** -> scopes **`repo`** + **`workflow`** -> add as `GH_GLOBAL`. One token covers everything cross-repo (`github-monitor`, `pr-review`, `feature`, `changelog` push-to), private reads, repository security advisories / PVR (disclosure skills), and secrets writeback. Auto-promoted to the run's `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `GH_READ_PAT` | *Legacy / optional.* Folded into `GH_GLOBAL`. Keep a separate read-only PAT only to give `bd-radar`'s private cross-repo enrichment a read token without granting the run write |
| `GH_SECRETS_PAT` | *Optional.* Folds into `GH_GLOBAL` (its `repo` scope already writes secrets). Set a dedicated PAT only to isolate secrets-write from the main token: github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens -> add this repo under Repository access (a PAT without it 404s) -> Repository permissions -> Secrets: Read and write. Used by OAuth-connected MCP servers or the Grok X-account harness |

`GH_SECRETS_PAT` gotcha: providers rotate the refresh token every run, and the runner needs this PAT to save each rotation back. Without it, auth breaks exactly one run after you connect. After adding it, re-connect any already-connected server once.

**Scope summary (one classic PAT as `GH_GLOBAL`):** `repo` = cross-repo + private read/write, security advisories / PVR, and secrets writeback; `workflow` = pushing `.github/workflows/` changes (`aeon-update`, `spawn-instance`, `auto-workflow`). `read:org` / `admin:org` are not needed. Use a **classic** PAT - the advisories / PVR API is unreliable with fine-grained tokens.

## 4. Skill API keys — all optional

Each is opt-in. Unset means the skills that want it skip or degrade.

| Secret | Used by | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `XAI_API_KEY` | tweet/X skills, `digest`, `shiplog`, `soul-builder` | console.x.ai |
| `COINGECKO_API_KEY` | crypto price/market skills | coingecko.com/en/api |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | on-chain RPC/data | dashboard.alchemy.com |
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | `tx-explain`, `investigation-report`, `onchain-monitor` | etherscan.io/apis — V2 is one multichain key covering Ethereum + Base |
| `BASESCAN_API_KEY` | `investigation-report` | Simplest is the **same value** as `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` |
| `BASE_RPC_URL` | Base on-chain skills | docs.base.org/chain/node-providers — a public RPC is used by default |
| `BANKR_API_KEY` | `distribute-tokens` (real on-chain sends) | bankr.bot/api-keys — Wallet API, not the LLM key |
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | `deploy-prototype` | vercel.com/account/settings/tokens |
| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | `article --visual` hero images | replicate.com/account/api-tokens |
| `ADMANAGE_API_KEY` | `schedule-ads` | admanage.ai/api-docs |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `send-email`, `vuln-scanner` disclosures | resend.com |
| `YDC_API_KEY` | `you-web-search` (required for it) | api.you.com — optional `YOUCOM_FRESHNESS` / `YOUCOM_LIVECRAWL` variables tune freshness + full-page crawl |
| `TASKMARKET_API_KEY` | `taskmarket-delegate` — only `create`/`submit`; `browse` works without | tasks.taskmarket.dev — optional `TASKMARKET_WORKER_ADDRESS` tags submissions |

## 5. Observability — optional

| Secret | Where |
|---|---|
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` | Langfuse → Settings → API Keys — `pk-lf-…` |
| `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | Same page — `sk-lf-…` |

Both must be set for tracing to activate. Then every run streams to Langfuse as a trace with LLM calls, tokens, cost, and prompts.

## 6. Repo variables (not secrets)

Set with `gh variable set NAME "value"`.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Point `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at any Anthropic-compatible endpoint, e.g. `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic` |
| `GATEWAY_ORDER` | Space-separated provider names — override the failover priority |
| `GROK_MODEL` | Model for the Grok gateway path |
| `GLM_MODEL` | Model for the GLM (Z.AI) gateway path (default `glm-5.2`) |
| `GLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | GLM gateway reasoning depth: `low` / `high` / `max` (default `high`) |
| `STATE_BACKEND` | `file` (default) · `dual` · `issues` — where run state lives |
| `HEALTH_ISSUES` | `0` disables the votable per-skill health Issues |
| `NOTIFY_MIN_SEVERITY` | Suppress notifications below this level |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL_FROM` | Default `aeon@notifications.aeon.bot` — **must be a Resend-verified sender** |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX` | Default `[Aeon]` |
| `LANGFUSE_HOST` | Default `https://cloud.langfuse.com` (EU). Set the US host to switch region |
| `LANGFUSE_TRACING` | `0` to disable |
| `LANGFUSE_LOG_CONTENT` | `0` = metadata only, no prompt bodies |
| `DISCORD_ALLOWED_AUTHOR_ID` / `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_ID` | Restrict who can command the agent inbound |
| `VENICE_BASE_URL` | Point Venice at a compatible endpoint |
