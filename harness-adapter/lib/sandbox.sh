# shellcheck shell=bash
# sandbox.sh — wrapper-level OS sandbox for uniform read-only enforcement.
#
# No harness enforces read-only usefully on its own. codex's native sandbox works
# but also kills the network; grok's --sandbox read-only is silently ignored on
# 0.2.101 (writes still land); pi, vibe and kimi ship no filesystem sandbox at
# all; and claude's --allowedTools is sidestepped by a shell redirection.
# So for read-only runs the DISPATCHER applies its own sandbox around whatever
# harness runs: the workspace (cwd) becomes unwritable, everything else stays
# usable (harnesses need to write their own state under $HOME and $TMPDIR, and
# the network stays open — read-only is about the repo, not egress).
# This mirrors aeon's semantic: "a read-only skill physically cannot mutate the
# repo" — and makes it mean the same thing on all seven harnesses.

sandbox_prefix() {
  # sandbox_prefix TMPDIR [EXPANDED_MCP] -> prints prefix argv tokens (one per
  # line), or returns 1 if no OS sandbox is available on this machine.
  #
  # EXPANDED_MCP (optional) is the ${VAR}-expanded .mcp.json run-harness built.
  # When the workspace also carries a literal `.mcp.json`, that file is overlaid
  # with the expanded copy for the duration of the run. Reason: several harnesses
  # AUTO-DISCOVER `<cwd>/.mcp.json` and that discovery WINS over the config the
  # adapter stages. kimi is the measured case — with a project .mcp.json present
  # it sent `Authorization: Bearer ${MCP_GLIM_TOKEN}` verbatim (the literal, not
  # the value) and silently ignored the expanded copy in $KIMI_CODE_HOME; against
  # a real server that is a 401, so the agent falls back to raw curl and reports
  # the MCP server as "not connected". Overlaying at the sandbox layer fixes it
  # for every harness at once without writing a secret into the working tree
  # (the bind is process-private and vanishes with the sandbox).
