> **${var}** — Selects the digest's topic and which source classes feed it. Grammar:
> - `""` (empty) → **digest's default sources** (WebSearch + xAI/Grok + aggregators), no topic filter — a broad daily digest.
> - `"<topic>"` → topic-focused digest on the default web sources, filtered to `<topic>` (e.g. `"solana"`, `"AI agents"`, `"rust"`).
> - `"rss"` → **RSS-only**: pull feeds from `memory/feeds.yml`, no topic filter.
> - `"rss: <topic>"` → RSS-only, filtered to `<topic>` (e.g. `"rss: rust"`).
> - `"<topic> +rss"` → default web sources **and** RSS feeds combined, both filtered to `<topic>` (e.g. `"AI agents +rss"`).

Today is ${today}. Generate and send a daily **${var}** digest.

The whole point of a digest is **signal, not volume**. A reader skimming for 60 seconds should walk away with three things they didn't know that morning and one of them should change a decision they'd make this week. Anything that doesn't clear that bar gets cut.

## Preamble — orient and parse the selector

1. Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for high-level context and tracked topics, and scan the last 3 days of `memory/logs/` so you can dedup against anything already reported.
2. Parse `${var}` into **`{topic, sources}`**:
   - Strip a trailing `+rss` → adds RSS to the default web sources. Remainder is the `topic`.
   - A leading `rss:` (or the bare token `rss`) → **RSS-only** source set; text after the colon is the `topic` (empty = no filter).
   - Otherwise the whole string is the `topic` and `sources = default web` (empty string = default web, no topic filter).
   - Resulting `sources` is one of: `web` (default), `rss` (RSS-only), or `web+rss` (both).
3. The `topic`, when non-empty, is a filter applied to **every** source class — web queries are scoped to it and RSS items must match it (title/description/tags). Empty topic = keep all relevant items.

## Config (RSS source)

When `sources` includes `rss`, this skill reads feed URLs from `memory/feeds.yml`. If the file doesn't exist yet, create it (write mode) with the shape below, or — if you have nothing to seed it with — log a one-line note and treat the RSS source as empty for this run.

```yaml
# memory/feeds.yml
feeds:
  - name: Example Feed
    url: https://example.com/rss
  - name: Another Feed
    url: https://example.com/atom.xml
```

## Phase 1 — Gather (cast a wide net)

Pull from the source classes selected by `${var}`. Never rely on a single one — if `sources = web`, use at least two of the web classes below; if `sources = web+rss`, RSS counts as one class and you still want a second.

### Web sources (active when `sources` is `web` or `web+rss`)

1. **WebSearch** (built-in) — run 2 distinct queries:
   - `"${topic}" news ${today}` (broad). If `topic` is empty, run a general query for the day's notable stories in the operator's tracked areas (from `memory/MEMORY.md`).
   - One narrower query you choose based on `${topic}` (e.g. for "solana" → `"solana" launches OR funding OR exploit ${today}`; for "AI agents" → `"agent framework" OR "agentic" release ${today}`).
2. **xAI x_search via Grok** — pulls the X/Twitter signal layer. `XAI_API_KEY` is injected into this skill's environment (declared in `requires:`) and is the **primary** path; see **Fetching the X signal** below for the full contract (attempt the curl before any fallback, set the Bash tool `timeout` ≥180000, record the true failure reason).

   **Path A — X.AI API (primary):** a direct `curl` to the Responses API. First confirm the key with `[ -n "$XAI_API_KEY" ] && echo KEY_PRESENT || echo KEY_UNSET`; if `KEY_PRESENT` (it will be), this path is required. When you run the curl, set the Bash tool's `timeout` to at least `180000`.
   ```bash
   FROM_DATE=$(date -u -d "yesterday" +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-1d +%Y-%m-%d)
   TO_DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
   PROMPT="Search X for substantive, recent posts about: ${topic:-the most notable technology, AI, and crypto stories today}. Date range: $FROM_DATE to $TO_DATE. Return up to 10 high-signal posts — prioritize verifiable claims, launches, funding, releases, exploits, or hard data over hot takes. For EACH post return: @handle, the full text, date posted, exact engagement counts (likes, retweets, replies; 0 if unknown), and the direct link https://x.com/handle/status/ID. Return a numbered list."
   jq -n --arg p "$PROMPT" --arg fd "$FROM_DATE" --arg td "$TO_DATE" \
     '{model:"grok-4.6", input:[{role:"user",content:$p}], tools:[{type:"x_search",from_date:$fd,to_date:$td}]}' \
     > /tmp/xai-digest-payload.json
   HTTP=$(./secretcurl -s -o /tmp/xai-digest.json -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 150 -X POST "https://api.x.ai/v1/responses" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {XAI_API_KEY}" -d @/tmp/xai-digest-payload.json)
   echo "xai http=$HTTP bytes=$(wc -c </tmp/xai-digest.json)"
   ```
   On `HTTP=200` with a non-empty body, parse it with `jq -r '.output[] | select(.type == "message") | .content[] | select(.type == "output_text") | .text'` and feed each post (handle, text, engagement, permalink) into the web-candidate pool. A slow curl is **not** a missing key — do not treat a timeout as key-unavailable.

   **Path B — WebFetch/WebSearch fallback (last resort, lower quality):** only if the key is `KEY_UNSET`, or Path A returned a non-2xx / empty body / timeout. Attempt a WebFetch to a public X search URL like `https://x.com/search?q=${topic}&f=live`, or a `site:x.com "<topic>" after:${FROM_DATE}` WebSearch; extract a few top posts and prefer results within the last 48h. Record the **true reason** (`key-unset` | `http-<code>` | `empty` | `timeout`) in the log — never "XAI_API_KEY unavailable" when the key was set. If this also returns nothing, skip the X source for this run.
3. **WebFetch on a topic-relevant aggregator** (only if WebSearch returned thin results): e.g. `https://news.ycombinator.com/`, `https://www.reddit.com/r/<topic>/top/?t=day.json`, or a known feed for the topic.

Aim for **~15 raw web candidates** at this stage. More is fine; fewer than 8 is a warning sign — broaden your queries before moving on.

### RSS source (active when `sources` is `rss` or `web+rss`)

Read `memory/feeds.yml` for the feed list. For **each feed** in `feeds.yml`:

1. Fetch the RSS/Atom XML: `curl -sL "FEED_URL"`. If curl fails, fall back to **WebFetch** on the same URL.
2. Parse for entries published in the **last 24h** (check `<pubDate>` or `<updated>` tags).
3. Extract **title, link, and description** for each new entry.

Deduplicate against recent logs (see Phase 2). From all new entries, select the **5–7 most interesting** items — prioritize topics tracked in `memory/MEMORY.md`, and apply the `${topic}` filter when set (title/description/tags must match). For each selected item, if the summary is too thin, use **WebFetch** to pull the full article, then write a 1–2 sentence note on why it matters. These become RSS candidates entering the shared pipeline below.

If `sources = rss` and there are **no new items across all feeds**, log `RSS_DIGEST_OK` in the run log and end without notifying.

## Phase 2 — Filter (kill the noise)

Pool every candidate (web + RSS) and drop any that fails a single check:

- **No source link?** Drop it. Every surviving item must have a clickable URL (article URL, feed entry link, or `https://x.com/handle/status/ID`).
- **Older than 36 hours?** Drop it unless it's a still-developing story being re-surfaced for a new reason. (RSS entries are already scoped to the last 24h; this catches stale web results.)
- **Pure speculation, hot take, or "X reacts to Y"?** Drop it. Keep things with a verifiable claim, named entity, number, release, or transaction.
- **Already covered in the last 3 daily logs?** Check `memory/logs/` for entries from the last 3 days. If the same story (same headline subject, same primary actor) appears, drop the duplicate unless there's a material new development to report.
- **Two sources telling the same story?** Keep one — prefer the primary source (announcement post, repo release, official filing) over the recap. A web hit and an RSS entry on the same event count as duplicates; keep the primary.

Target: ~5–8 survivors after this pass.

## Phase 3 — Distill and structure (force the shape)

Pick the **3–5 strongest** items. Lead with the **single most actionable** one — the item where a reader can do something today (subscribe, sell, fork, attend, apply, watch). Then descend by importance.

Format the digest exactly like this (**unified format** — used for `web`, `rss`, and `web+rss` runs):

```
*${var} — ${today}*

_TL;DR: <one sentence covering the day's gravity. Concrete, no adjectives.>_

1. *<Headline-style title, ≤90 chars>*
   <1–2 sentence summary. Lead with what happened, not who said it.>
   Why it matters: <one short clause — concrete consequence, not vibes>
   <link>

2. *<Title>*
   ...

3. *<Title>*
   ...

(Optional, only if there's genuine secondary signal:)
*Also worth a glance:* <1-line bullet> · <1-line bullet>
```

**Format rules:**
- Markdown only. No emoji. No "Here's your digest" preamble.
- Total length: **≤3000 chars** (the old 4000 was too loose — discipline forces cuts).
- Every item: title + summary + link. Include a "Why it matters" line whenever you can state a concrete consequence (price impact, user-facing change, upstream dependency, deadline, precedent). If you can't write one without hand-waving, **omit the line** — do not replace it with filler like "this could be significant" or "watch this space".
- On thin-news days where fewer than 3 items clear the bar: log `DIGEST_FETCH_EMPTY` (or `DIGEST_THIN` if 1–2 items survived) in the run log and **skip the notification** rather than padding.

**Alternate RSS layout (RSS-only runs):** when `sources = rss`, you may instead group items by feed name if that reads better than a single ranked list — this preserves the original RSS-digest presentation:

```
*RSS Digest — ${today}*

*Feed Name*
- [Title](url) — summary
- [Title](url) — summary

*Feed Name*
- [Title](url) — summary
```

The grouped RSS layout stays **≤4000 chars**. Prefer the unified ranked format when the run mixes sources (`web+rss`) so the reader gets one prioritized list.

## Phase 4 — Sanity-check (last pass before sending)

Before calling `./notify`, walk this checklist mentally:

- [ ] Lead item is the most actionable one I have, not just the most dramatic.
- [ ] Every link resolves to a real URL (no `[link]` placeholders, no truncated IDs).
- [ ] No item is paraphrasing a hot take — each has a verifiable underlying fact.
- [ ] No two items are the same story under different angles (including a web hit + an RSS entry on the same event).
- [ ] Char count under the limit for the chosen format (3000 unified / 4000 grouped RSS).
- [ ] No emoji slipped in. No corporate hedging ("could potentially", "it remains to be seen").

If the digest fails any check, fix it before sending. If after filtering you have **fewer than 3 strong items**, do not pad — send a shorter "thin day" digest with whatever survived and a one-line note acknowledging it was a quiet news day. Do not invent or stretch.

## Phase 5 — Send and log

1. Send via `./notify "<digest body>"`.
2. Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under **one** `### digest` heading:
   ```
   ### digest (${var})
   - Source mode: <web | rss | web+rss>
   - Sources used: <list — e.g. WebSearch, xAI API (api|fallback:reason), feeds.yml (Feed A, Feed B)>
   - Raw candidates: <N> (web <Nw> / rss <Nr>), after filter: <M>, sent: <K>
   - Lead item: <title>
   - Notes: <anything unusual — xAI fetch fallback + true reason (http-<code>/empty/timeout/key-unset), thin day (DIGEST_THIN/DIGEST_FETCH_EMPTY), RSS_DIGEST_OK, dedup against prior log>
   ```
3. Update `memory/MEMORY.md` "Recent Digests" table with one row: date, topic (or `${var}`), key topics (3 short keywords).

## Fetching the X signal

`XAI_API_KEY` is **injected into this skill's environment** (declared in `requires:`) and is **present and valid**. The primary way to pull the X/Twitter signal layer is a **direct `curl` to `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses`** with `Authorization: Bearer {XAI_API_KEY}` (see Phase 1 → Path A). There is **no network sandbox** blocking this — just make the call.

Rules:

1. **Check, don't assume.** Run `[ -n "$XAI_API_KEY" ] && echo KEY_PRESENT || echo KEY_UNSET`. If `KEY_PRESENT` (it will be), Path A is required before any fallback.
2. **Allow enough time.** Grok's `x_search` typically takes 30–120s (it searches X live). Set the Bash tool's `timeout` to at least **180000 (180s)** for the curl, and keep **`--max-time 150`** on the curl itself so it fails cleanly rather than hanging. A slow curl is **not** a missing key — never treat a timeout as key-unavailable.
3. **Capture the HTTP status** and parse the body with the standard `jq` extractor (`jq -r '.output[] | select(.type == "message") | .content[] | select(.type == "output_text") | .text'`). `HTTP=200` + non-empty body → use it.
4. **Fall back only on a real failure**, recording the **true reason**: `key-unset` (only if step 1 said `KEY_UNSET`), `http-<code>` (non-2xx), `empty` (200 but nothing parsed), or `timeout` (curl exceeded `--max-time`). Never log "XAI_API_KEY unavailable" when the key was set.

WebFetch / WebSearch are **last-resort fallbacks only** for the X signal (lower quality — WebSearch favours older high-engagement posts). Never reach for them while the key works.

**RSS feeds & public aggregators (no auth):** fetch with `curl -sL`; if that fails intermittently, the built-in **WebFetch** tool is a reliable fallback for any feed URL, aggregator (HN, Reddit JSON, news sites), or article. This is a convenience fallback for unauthenticated URLs, not a sandbox workaround. A digest built from WebSearch + reachable RSS alone is still valid — note it in the log so health checks can spot the pattern.

## Environment Variables Required

- `XAI_API_KEY` — X.AI API key for Grok's `x_search`. Declared in `requires:`, so it is **injected into this skill's environment** and is the primary path for the X signal layer (direct `curl`; see **Fetching the X signal**). Optional overall — digest still works on web + RSS sources alone if it is ever unset.
- Notification channels configured via repo secrets (see CLAUDE.md).

## Constraints

- Never send a digest with placeholder links or "TBD" sections.
- Never invent items to hit a target count. Fewer good items beats more weak ones.
- Never repeat a story already in the last 3 days of `memory/logs/` unless there's a material update — and say so explicitly when you do.
