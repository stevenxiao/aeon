Today is ${today}. This is the fleet's **downstream updater** - the counterpart to `fork-fleet`. `fork-fleet` looks *outward* from the parent to find work in the forks worth pulling *up*; this skill runs *inside* an instance and pulls the parent's shipped framework changes *down* - new skills, script/harness fixes, workflow and doc updates - and lands them as a reviewable PR. It is how an instance stays current with `aeonfun/aeon` without a hand-run rsync-overlay rebase.

## Operating principles

- **PR, never push to `main`.** Every framework change ships as one reviewable PR. The operator merges.
- **Never clobber operator config.** `aeon.yml`, `STRATEGY.md`, `soul/`, `memory/`, `output/`, `.mcp.json` and the git-derived catalogs are instance-owned. Upstream changes to them are **surfaced for manual review in the PR body**, never written into the tree.
- **3-way, not blind overwrite.** A framework file the operator has already customized is **auto-merged** when its local edits and upstream's edits touch disjoint regions (a real `git merge-file` 3-way, S6); it is only listed as a **conflict** for a human when the same lines changed on both sides. This is what lets a hand-narrowed workflow keep receiving unrelated upstream fixes without a manual merge every run.
- **Silent when in sync.** Baseline == upstream HEAD ⇒ nothing to do, no notification.
- **The baseline is the watermark, and it advances by merge.** The new baseline SHA is written *into the PR branch*, so the watermark only moves when the operator merges the PR. Unresolved conflicts are tracked separately so advancing the baseline can never silently drop them.

---

## Steps

### S0. Bootstrap + load state

```bash
mkdir -p memory/topics
[ -f memory/topics/aeon-update-state.json ] || echo '{"baseline_sha":null,"upstream":null,"last_run":null,"last_pr":null,"pending_conflicts":[]}' > memory/topics/aeon-update-state.json
```

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context and scan the last ~3 days of `memory/logs/` - drop anything already reported so a repeat run isn't re-sent. Read the state file:
- `BASELINE` = `.baseline_sha` (the upstream commit this instance was last synced to).
- `PENDING` = `.pending_conflicts` (files surfaced as conflicts in a prior run, not yet resolved).

### S1. Parse `${var}`

- `MODE` = `report` if the token `report` (or `dry`) is present, else `sync`.
- `REPO_OVERRIDE` = value of a `repo=owner/name` token, if any.
- `RESET` = value of a `reset=` token, if any (`fork-point` or a 7-40 char SHA).

### S2. Resolve the upstream source

```bash
SELF=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
UPSTREAM="${REPO_OVERRIDE:-$(gh api "repos/${SELF}" --jq '.parent.full_name // empty')}"
[ -z "$UPSTREAM" ] && UPSTREAM="aeonfun/aeon"
```

If `UPSTREAM` == `SELF`, this instance **is** canon - there is nothing upstream to pull. Write status `AEON_UPDATE_IS_UPSTREAM` to `memory/logs/${today}.md`, send **no** notification, and stop.

```bash
UP_DEFAULT=$(gh api "repos/${UPSTREAM}" --jq '.default_branch')
HEAD_SHA=$(gh api "repos/${UPSTREAM}/commits/${UP_DEFAULT}" --jq '.sha')
```

### S3. Establish / reset the baseline

- **`reset=fork-point`** → `BASELINE=$(gh api "repos/${UPSTREAM}/compare/${HEAD_SHA}...$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --jq '.merge_base_commit.sha')`. `reset=<sha>` → `BASELINE=<sha>`. Persist immediately to state, then continue.
- **First run (`BASELINE` null and no `reset`):** a fresh instance already carries all of canon from fork time, so there is no delta to apply - just **anchor the watermark**. Set `baseline_sha = HEAD_SHA`, write state, log `AEON_UPDATE_BASELINE_SET`, send a one-line notify (`baseline initialized at <head7>; future runs sync from here`), and stop. (To backfill everything since the fork point instead, re-run with `reset=fork-point`.)
- **`BASELINE` == `HEAD_SHA`:** in sync. Re-verify `PENDING` (S8) in case a prior conflict is now resolved, update state, log `AEON_UPDATE_IN_SYNC`, notify nothing, stop.

### S4. Compare baseline → HEAD

```bash
gh api "repos/${UPSTREAM}/compare/${BASELINE}...${HEAD_SHA}" --jq '{
  ahead: .ahead_by, behind: .behind_by, status,
  commits: [.commits[]? | {sha: .sha[0:7], msg: (.commit.message | split("\n")[0]), date: .commit.author.date}],
  files:   [.files[]?   | {filename, status, previous_filename, additions, deletions}]
}' > /tmp/aeon-update-compare.json
```

Error handling:
- **404 / `status: "diverged"` with no merge base** (baseline not an ancestor of HEAD - history rewrite or unrelated repo): stop with `AEON_UPDATE_BASELINE_UNREACHABLE`; notify the operator to re-run with `reset=fork-point` or `reset=<sha>`.
- Cross-repo compare returns at most **300 files**; if `.files` looks truncated, note `files_truncated=true` in the report - the operator can run again after merging to pick up the remainder.

### S5. Partition changed files

Classify every entry in `.files` by path. A file is **OPERATOR-owned** (surfaced, never auto-written) if its path matches any of:

```
aeon.yml            STRATEGY.md         soul/**             memory/**
output/**           .mcp.json           .env*               aeon.db
skills.lock         eyebrowlock.json    catalog/*.json      .claude/**  (except .claude/skills/aeon/**)
apps/dashboard/outputs/**
```

Everything else is **OWNED** (a candidate for auto-apply): `skills/**`, `scripts/**`, `bin/**`, `harness-adapter/**`, `.github/**`, `apps/**` (except `apps/dashboard/outputs/**`), `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/**`, `.github/README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`, `eyebrow.policy.json`, and tracked root helpers (`aeon`, ...).

`catalog/*.json` and `eyebrowlock.json` are OPERATOR-owned here **only** so they are never blindly copied - they are **regenerated** from the synced sources in S7, which is the correct way to reconcile them.

### S6. 3-way classify each OWNED file

Set up a workspace and, for each OWNED file `f`, fetch upstream's HEAD and BASELINE blobs:

```bash
WORK=$(mktemp -d)
fetch() { gh api "repos/${UPSTREAM}/contents/$1?ref=$2" --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null | base64 -d; }   # $1=path $2=ref
h() { sha256sum 2>/dev/null | cut -d' ' -f1; }
```

Decide `f`'s disposition from its `status` and a content 3-way (local-current vs upstream@BASELINE vs upstream@HEAD):

| `status` | Test | Disposition |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `added` | path absent locally | **CLEAN-ADD** (write HEAD blob) |
| `added` | path present locally (collision, e.g. a fork-only skill) | **CONFLICT** |
| `modified` | `sha256(local) == sha256(HEAD blob)` | already synced → **SKIP** |
| `modified` | `sha256(local) == sha256(BASELINE blob)` (operator never touched it) | **CLEAN-UPDATE** (write HEAD blob) |
| `modified` | otherwise (operator customized it) | **3-WAY MERGE** → CLEAN-MERGE or CONFLICT (see below) |
| `removed` | `sha256(local) == sha256(BASELINE blob)` | **CLEAN-DELETE** (`git rm`) |
| `removed` | local differs or absent | **CONFLICT** (or already gone → SKIP if absent) |
| `renamed` | treat as `removed previous_filename` + `added filename` under the rules above | per-part |

Never CLEAN-DELETE a `skills/<name>/` directory whose `<name>` is not present in upstream's tree - fork-only skills are operator work and are structurally untouched (upstream's compare can only reference paths that exist upstream).

Also never CLEAN-DELETE a `skills/<name>/` directory if `<name>` is currently `enabled: true` in the operator's `aeon.yml` (`grep -E "^  ${name}: *\{[^}]*enabled: true" aeon.yml`) - upstream retiring a skill the operator has actively scheduled is exactly the case `validate-config.js`'s skill-refs check exists to catch, but only *after* the PR is merged; nothing in the PR review itself would otherwise flag it. Downgrade this case to **CONFLICT** (reason: `enabled-skill-removed-upstream`) instead of deleting - the directory stays, and S9 surfaces it as its own loud PR-body section rather than folding it into "Applied cleanly" or the generic conflict list.

**3-way content merge (OWNED files only).** A `modified` file that reached the `otherwise` row means the operator diverged from BASELINE *and* upstream changed the file too. Do not give up on it - most of the time the two sets of edits are in different parts of the file (e.g. the operator narrowed the workflow's `env:` secrets block while upstream bumped a `timeout` and a retry loop elsewhere), and a real 3-way merge combines both losslessly. Attempt it before declaring a conflict:

```bash
fetch "$f" "$BASELINE"  > "$WORK/base"    # upstream@BASELINE (the common ancestor)
fetch "$f" "$HEAD_SHA"  > "$WORK/head"    # upstream@HEAD (what to bring in)
cp "$f" "$WORK/local"                      # operator's current copy (ours)
if git merge-file -p --diff3 "$WORK/local" "$WORK/base" "$WORK/head" > "$WORK/merged.$$" 2>/dev/null; then
  disposition=CLEAN-MERGE   # exit 0 = disjoint hunks; the merged file carries BOTH edits - write it in S7
else
  disposition=CONFLICT      # exit >0 = the same lines changed on both sides; surface for a human as before
fi
```

`git merge-file` exits `0` only when the merge is clean (operator and upstream touched disjoint regions); the merged output preserves the operator's customization AND applies upstream's change. A non-zero exit means a genuine overlap - keep it a **CONFLICT** and list it with the upstream diff (S9). **Only OWNED files are ever 3-way-merged; OPERATOR-owned paths are always surfaced, never written.** A merged file gets the same S7 YAML/JSON parse-check as any written file - if the merge produced something that no longer parses, abort that file back to CONFLICT rather than committing it.

### S7. Apply CLEAN changes on a branch (sync mode only)

If `MODE == report`, skip to S9. Otherwise:

```bash
BR="aeon-update/sync-$(echo "$HEAD_SHA" | cut -c1-7)"
git checkout -b "$BR"
```

Write every **CLEAN-ADD** / **CLEAN-UPDATE** (`mkdir -p "$(dirname f)"` then write the HEAD blob to `f`), write every **CLEAN-MERGE** (the merged file `$WORK/merged.$$` from S6, over the existing `f`), and `git rm` every **CLEAN-DELETE**. **CONFLICT** and **OPERATOR** files are *not* touched - they go in the PR body only. (CLEAN-MERGE counts as a clean apply for the "nothing CLEAN applied" test below.)

If any `skills/**` path was applied, regenerate the derived catalogs from the synced sources (never copy them from upstream):

```bash
bin/generate-skills-json && bin/generate-packs-json && bin/generate-skill-icons
node scripts/gen-agents-md.js || true
```

**Refresh the eyebrow integrity lock for any NEWLY-ADDED skill.** `ci-skill-integrity` fails a PR when a present skill's `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` has no `"discoveredFrom": "skills/<slug>/SKILL.md"` entry in `eyebrowlock.json`. That entry is produced only by the `eyebrow` binary, which is **not preinstalled in this run** - so a CLEAN-ADD of a new skill would otherwise land the PR CI-red. Fetch the binary (the version `ci-skill-integrity.yml` pins - currently `v0.4.1` from `alexverify/eyebrow`), verifying the release asset against a **pinned SHA256** (the tag is mutable, and this runs in the full secret env), then rescan:

```bash
EYEBROW_OK=0
EB=$(command -v eyebrow || true)
if [ -z "$EB" ]; then
  # SHA256-pin the release asset (trust-on-first-pin). The v0.4.1 tag is mutable -
  # a re-uploaded asset would otherwise be fetched AND executed in this run's full
  # secret env. Verify the tarball hash against the constant below BEFORE extract
  # or exec; a mismatch means the tag moved, so do NOT run it - fall through to the
  # fail-safe. Linux runner (ubuntu-latest) assumed; unknown arch => skip.

    if [ "$GOT" = "$EB_SHA" ]; then
      tar xzf "$WORK/eb/$TB" -C "$WORK/eb" 2>/dev/null \
        && EB=$(find "$WORK/eb" -type f -name eyebrow | head -1) && chmod +x "$EB" 2>/dev/null || true

# Run with a SCRUBBED env (allowlist PATH+HOME only). eyebrow scan is a local
# file-hasher - it needs no secrets and no network - so denying it the run's

# stays 0 and the fail-safe below covers it.
[ -n "$EB" ] && env -i PATH="$PATH" HOME="$HOME" "$EB" scan --path . --lockfile eyebrowlock.json 2>/dev/null && EYEBROW_OK=1
```

**Fail-safe - guarantees a green PR without the binary.** If `EYEBROW_OK` is still `0` (binary unavailable or scan failed) and this run has any **CLEAN-ADD of a `skills/**` SKILL.md**, do not ship a skill the lock cannot cover: revert each such new skill from the branch (`git rm -r --cached skills/<slug>` + drop it from the working tree) and re-classify it as **CONFLICT** with reason `needs-eyebrowlock-scan`. S9 surfaces it with the exact operator command (`eyebrow scan --path . --lockfile eyebrowlock.json` then commit). A **CLEAN-UPDATE / CLEAN-MERGE of an existing** skill needs no rescan - `eyebrow verify` allows content drift (it fails only on a new egress host or a new CRITICAL), and the skill already has a lock entry. This trades auto-installing a brand-new upstream skill (rare) for never landing a red PR; the skill still arrives, just as a one-line manual step in the PR.

Then validate config:

```bash
node scripts/validate-config.js aeon.yml || echo "validate-config flagged (may be pre-existing drift; note, do not abort on it)"
```

If **nothing CLEAN applied** (every upstream change was CONFLICT or OPERATOR): open no PR. Fold all changes into the report, log `AEON_UPDATE_MANUAL_ONLY`, and go to S10 (notify the operator that the sync needs a manual merge). If a file we wrote breaks YAML/JSON parsing, abort: `git checkout . && git checkout ${UP_DEFAULT} && git branch -D "$BR"`, exit `AEON_UPDATE_VALIDATION_FAILED`, notify with the failing file.

### S8. Advance the baseline + reconcile conflicts (in the branch)

Recompute `PENDING`: for every CONFLICT file this run **plus** every prior `PENDING` entry, keep it only if `sha256(local) != sha256(HEAD blob)` (still genuinely divergent). Drop the rest (resolved). **A file that was CLEAN-MERGE-applied this run is resolved - never carry it as pending** (its `sha256(local) != sha256(HEAD blob)` because it still holds the operator's edits, but the upstream change is now merged in, so the naive test would wrongly keep it forever; a 3-way-merged file is only a CONFLICT again if a *future* upstream change overlaps the operator's lines). Likewise drop any prior PENDING entry whose file was CLEAN-MERGE- or CLEAN-UPDATE-applied this run. Exception: `enabled-skill-removed-upstream` entries have no HEAD blob to diff (the path is deleted upstream) - resolve them instead when the skill is no longer `enabled: true` in the operator's current `aeon.yml` (they disabled it, so the CLEAN-DELETE rule can now apply next run) or upstream re-adds a path of that name (re-classify as CONFLICT/modified or CLEAN-UPDATE under the normal rules).

Write `memory/topics/aeon-update-state.json` and commit it **with** the sync so merging advances the watermark:

```json
{
  "baseline_sha": "${HEAD_SHA}",
  "upstream": "${UPSTREAM}",
  "last_run": "${today}",
  "last_pr": null,
  "applied": { "added": N, "updated": N, "deleted": N },
  "pending_conflicts": [
    { "path": "scripts/foo.sh", "reason": "operator-customized", "upstream_commits": ["abc1234"] }
  ]
}
```

Advancing `baseline_sha` to HEAD means clean files never re-notify, while `pending_conflicts` carries unresolved merges forward independently - so they resurface each run until the operator actually reconciles them, and are also written to the PR body. (In `report` mode, do **not** write state - a dry run mutates nothing.)

### S9. Commit + open the PR (sync mode; skip in report mode)

```bash
git add -A
git commit -F /tmp/aeon-update-commit.txt      # never inline the message with -m (backticks/`$()` in commit text get shell-substituted)
git push -u origin "$BR"
gh pr create --repo "$SELF" --base "$UP_DEFAULT" \
  --title "aeon-update: sync ${N_COMMITS} upstream commits (${BASE7}..${HEAD7})" \
  --body-file /tmp/aeon-update-pr-body.md
```

`/tmp/aeon-update-commit.txt`:
```
aeon-update: sync upstream ${BASE7}..${HEAD7}

${N_COMMITS} upstream commits from ${UPSTREAM}. ${N_APPLIED} files applied cleanly, ${N_CONFLICT} need manual review. Baseline advanced to ${HEAD7}.
```

PR body (`/tmp/aeon-update-pr-body.md`) - only include sections that have content:
```markdown
## Upstream sync: `${UPSTREAM}` `${BASE7}..${HEAD7}`

**${N_COMMITS} commits** ({earliest date} → {latest date}) · **${N_APPLIED} applied** · **${N_CONFLICT} manual** · baseline → `${HEAD7}`.

### Applied cleanly
- **New skills:** `foo`, `bar`   _(regenerated catalogs + agents.md + skill-icons)_
- **Modified skills:** `baz`
- **Scripts / harness:** `scripts/notify.sh`, ...
- **Workflows:** `.github/workflows/...`
- **Auto-merged (3-way):** `.github/workflows/aeon.yml`, ...  _(your local customization kept; upstream's disjoint changes applied - review the merged hunks)_
- **Docs / other:** `docs/...`, `CLAUDE.md`, ...

### ⚠️ Currently-enabled skills removed upstream
For each CONFLICT with reason `enabled-skill-removed-upstream` (S6):
- `verdikta-hunter` — enabled in your `aeon.yml`, deleted upstream in {commit(s)}. **Not deleted here** so nothing breaks. Pick one: keep it as a fork-only skill going forward (nothing else to do), or disable it in `aeon.yml` to match upstream's current default set.

### Needs manual review (conflicts - your local copy diverges from upstream)
For each *other* conflict reason (`enabled-skill-removed-upstream` is covered above, don't duplicate it here): what upstream changed and why it wasn't auto-applied.
- `scripts/foo.sh` — you customized this locally; upstream changed it in {commits}. Upstream diff:
  ```diff
  {short upstream base..head diff for the file}
  ```

### Operator config changed upstream (not auto-applied - reconcile by hand)
- `aeon.yml` — upstream added skills / changed defaults: {summary}. Merge the new entries you want (keep your enable/schedule/model choices).
- `soul/…`, `STRATEGY.md` — {summary, if changed}

### Upstream commits
| SHA | Summary |
|-----|---------|
| abc1234 | ... |
```

Capture the PR URL; write it back into `last_pr` in the branch's state file (amend the state commit) so the merged watermark records its own PR.

### S10. Log + notify

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md` under `### aeon-update`: status, `UPSTREAM`, `${BASE7}..${HEAD7}`, applied/conflict counts, PR URL (or `report`/`manual-only`), and `pending_conflicts` count.

**Notify only on signal** - match `soul/` voice if present. Send when there is a PR, a report with changes, or a manual-only situation; stay silent for `IN_SYNC` / `BASELINE_SET`-with-nothing. Keep it ≤4000 chars:

```
*aeon-update — ${today}*
{verdict: "synced N commits → PR" | "N changes need manual merge" | "report: N commits behind"}

Upstream `${UPSTREAM}` is ${AHEAD} commits ahead. Applied ${N_APPLIED} cleanly, ${N_CONFLICT} need review.
{Top applied highlight: e.g. "new skill: `token-radar`; harness fix in run-harness"}
{If conflicts: "Manual: `aeon.yml` (new skills), `scripts/foo.sh` (local edit)"}

PR: {url}   (or "dry run — nothing changed")
```

Pass `--mute-key "aeon-update:${HEAD7}"` so a muted sync doesn't re-ping for the same upstream HEAD.

## Exit taxonomy

| Code | When | Notify |
|------|------|--------|
| `AEON_UPDATE_OK` | PR opened with ≥1 clean file (conflicts, if any, listed in it) | Yes - PR link |
| `AEON_UPDATE_MANUAL_ONLY` | Upstream changed only operator-owned / conflicting files - no clean apply, no PR | Yes - manual call-out |
| `AEON_UPDATE_REPORT` | `report` mode - delta computed, nothing mutated | Yes - dry-run summary |
| `AEON_UPDATE_IN_SYNC` | Baseline already == upstream HEAD | No (log only) |
| `AEON_UPDATE_BASELINE_SET` | First run - watermark anchored, nothing applied | One-line notify |
| `AEON_UPDATE_IS_UPSTREAM` | This instance is the upstream repo itself | No (log only) |
| `AEON_UPDATE_BASELINE_UNREACHABLE` | Baseline is not an ancestor of HEAD (history rewrite) | Yes - asks for `reset=` |
| `AEON_UPDATE_VALIDATION_FAILED` | An applied file broke YAML/JSON parsing → branch reverted | Yes - failing file |

## Constraints

- **Never** push to `main` or auto-write an OPERATOR-owned path (`aeon.yml`, `soul/`, `memory/`, `STRATEGY.md`, `.mcp.json`, `output/`).
- **Never** delete a fork-only skill, and **never** copy `catalog/*.json` / `eyebrowlock.json` from upstream - regenerate them.
- **Never** advance `baseline_sha` without carrying unresolved conflicts forward in `pending_conflicts`.
- Cross-repo compare caps at 300 files - note `files_truncated=true` and let a follow-up run pick up the rest.
- A clean, in-sync run is **correct**, not a failure - it notifies nothing.

## Network note

Every network call is `gh api`, which authenticates via `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically - no `curl`, no `./secretcurl`, no `$SECRET` on the command line for the Bash permission layer to refuse, and no secret beyond the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. There are no irreversible side-effects: the skill's only mutation is a PR against this instance's own repo, which the operator reviews and merges. Retry policy: on `403` with `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`, sleep 60s and retry once; on a persistent contents-API failure for one file, mark it `UNREADABLE` in the report and continue with a partial sync rather than aborting the whole run.
